# Vehicle Builder OOP Application

## Description

The **Vehicle Builder OOP Application** is a TypeScript-powered command-line tool that allows users to create, manage, and interact with various types of vehicles, including cars, trucks, and motorbikes. Users can input details about the vehicles they create and perform specific actions with each vehicle. Additionally, trucks can tow other vehicles, and motorbikes can perform wheelies, showcasing their unique features.

This project demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) principles such as inheritance, interfaces, and polymorphism while utilizing TypeScript for type safety and enhanced developer experience.
